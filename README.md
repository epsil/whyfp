Why Functional Programming Matters
==================================

Haskell translation of the code examples in John Hughes' article
*Why Functional Programming Matters*.

The paper itself is under copyright of BCS Books, but the Miranda
version (which is quite similar to Haskell) can be downloaded from
the author's website. The code in this repository is released under
fair use.
